# this file's purpose is to use vim hotkeys in command line
# apps which use GNU's readline. I mainly use it for psql.

# turn off the terminal bell
set bell-style none

# use vim hotkeys
set editing-mode vi

# use jj instead of escape
$if mode=vi
  set keymap vi-insert
  "jj": vi-movement-mode
$endif
